Another framework?
Just as not all of us drive the same car or use the same cellphone, there's no reason why a CSS frameworks should be a one size fits all approach. After working with multiple frameworks and tweaking them to my own needs I decided to start from scratch and that's when Not Just a Grid was born.
What's Included?
Not Just a Grid includes separate stylesheets covering multi-column layouts, typography, forms, tables and user experience enhancement. Also included is a range of common images that are used for both visual styling and user interface enhancement. These images can easily be changed to suit your needs.
