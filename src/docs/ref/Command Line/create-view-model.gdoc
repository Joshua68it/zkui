h2. Description

Creates a [View Model|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel] for the given base name. For example for a base name "search" a @View Model@ called @SearchVM@ will be created in the @grails-app/vms@ directory.

The View-Model of [MVVM|http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html] is a value converter meaning that the View-Model is responsible for exposing the data objects from the Model in such a way that those objects are easily managed and consumed. In this respect, the View-Model is more Model than View, and handles most if not all of the Viewâ€™s display logic

Note that this command is merely for convenience and you can also create @View Model@ in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
{code:java}
grails create-view-model [name]
{code}
