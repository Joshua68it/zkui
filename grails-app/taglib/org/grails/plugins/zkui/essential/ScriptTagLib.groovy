    /**
     * The script component is used to specify the script codes running at the browser. Notice that, unlike zscript, the script codes are running at the browser. They are usually written in JavaScript which is supported by the most of browsers. The simplest format is as follows.<span class="mw-headline" id="Alternatives">Alternatives</span>
     *
     * @attr src Sets the URI of the source that contains the script codes. You either add the script codes directly with the Label children, or set the URI to load the script codes with setSrc(java.lang.String). But, not both.
     * @attr content Sets the content of the script element. By content we mean the JavaScript codes that will be enclosed by the HTML SCRIPT element.
     * @attr char Sets the character encoding of the source. It is used with setSrc(java.lang.String). Refer to HTML Character Setsfor more information.
     * @attr defer Sets whether to defer the execution of the script codes.
     * @attr packages Sets the list of packages to load before evaluating the script defined in getContent(). If more than a package to load, separate them with comma.
     * @attr type Deprecated.Â  As of release 5.0.0, it is meaningless since text/javascript is always assumed.
     * @attr id Description copied from interface: Component Sets the ID. The scope of uniqueness depends on whether this component is a root component. Refer to Component.getId() for more details. Default: "" (an empty string; it means no ID at all).
     * @attr mold Description copied from interface: Component Sets the mold to render this component.
     * @attr widgetClass Description copied from interface: Component Sets the widget class (aka., the widget type). The widget class is a JavaScript class, including the package name. For example, "zul.wnd.Window".
     * @attr stubonly Description copied from interface: Component Sets whether this component is stub-only. By stub-only, we mean we don't need to maintain the states of the component at the server side. Default: "inherit" (i.e., the same as the parent's stub-only, and "false" is assumed if none of parents is specified with stub-only). If a component is set to stub-only, the application running at the server shall not access it anymore after renderred to the client. The ZK loader will try to minimize the memory footprint by merging stub-only components and replacing with light-weight components. However, the event listeners and handlers are preserved, so they will be invoked if the corresponding event is received. Since the original component is gone, the event is the more generic format: an instance of Event (rather than MouseEvent or others). If a component is stub-only, the application usually access it only at the client since all widgets are preserved at the client (so are events). This method is available only for ZK EE.
     * @attr definition Description copied from interface: ComponentCtrl Sets the component definition by specifing the name.
     * @attr visible Description copied from interface: Component Sets whether this component is visible.
